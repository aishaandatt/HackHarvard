# LOCUS

### Motivation of our project

##### LOCUS aims to help maintain a platform for people to collaborate in multiple ways .The idea is to develop a platform with the primary goal: **education for all**, irresective of one's race, caste, ethnicity, gender, religion, sex, etc. We are of the opinion that anyone should be able to collaborate and learn without any social boundaries serving as a hindrance to their learning.

### About our Project

##### ON the website we have a basic feed for study rooms-fairly plain and simple, It is for anyone to come and learn or to exchange ideas on any topic. Anyone registered on the website has access to study rooms or can create a room of their own, with a topic of their choice and engross themselves with people of similar interests.

##### We have also integrated a search bar for searching rooms for people to be able to collaborate more efficiently.

###### Browse and activity feed columns helps to keep the website more engaging since anyone can go roooms directly and join in .
